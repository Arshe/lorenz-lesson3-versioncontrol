                Version control is method of organizing, managing and storing changes to files or groups of related files over time. Version control is especially useful when working in a team environment. A key feature of version control is allowing a user or users
                to revert to previous versions of a file or group of files. Entire projects can be reverted back to a previous state as well as specific files. Version control prevents files from being overwritten as a function of how files are saved
                and allows file to recovered easily in the event that they are lost or damaged. Version control also allows users to compare changes to files and projects over time which, allows users to find out who made a change and when it was made.
                This information facilitates isolating potential problems. Version control prevents issues caused by multiple users trying to edit a file at the same time. Version control can be applied to most types of files. Version control feature
                are present in many types of software including word processing and content management systems. Version control is an effective method of managing a project with a large number of files. Version control allows people to make changes to
                a project without having to worry about losing all of their prior work.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are typically stand-alone applications that implement version control. While a VCS is useful for an individual developer, they have the most significant benefits in a collaborative environment. Developers check out
                files in order to edit them. This prevents problems that would otherwise result from people trying to edit the same file at the same time. When a developer is finished editing a file they save it to the VCS server where the project is
                stored. This process is referred to as making a commit. VCS store multiple versions of a project or file, this allows changes to be easily undone. A VCS allows for fine-grained control over file access and keeps track of who made an edit
                to a file and when they did it. As well as what edits were made and merging changes to some types of files with the same name. A repository stored on a remote server is called a remote repository. Local repositories are stored on the local
                machine of device of a user. Local repositories are created by either creating a new repository or cloning a remote repository. Even if someone is working alone a VCS is great way to backup work.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distinct distributed version control system. While most if not all other VCS handle data as a set of files and the changes made to them over time, Git treats data as a stream of snapshots of the state of files over time. Nearly every
                operation is local, generally no information is needed from another computer. Because of this Git is much faster than a conventional Centralized VCS and allows users to commit changes to local copy of a database even when offline. Git
                does a checksum operation when committing files to a repository which means Git always knows when a file is changed, who made changes and when changes were made. Git also detects when files are corrupted or lost in transit. Most commands
                only add things to a git repository. That means that most operations can be undone making in hard to accidentally lose files. There are three states of files in Git: committed, modified, and staged.
                <ul>
                    <li> Committed files are stored in your local database.</li>
                    <li>Modified files have been changed committed to your database yet.</li>
                    <li>Staged files have been marked in the current version of your database and will go into your next commit snapshot.</li>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a git repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways of getting a Git repository. One is to convert an untracked file directory into a git repository. The other is to clone a git repository from somewhere else. To initialize a git repository in an existing directory you must
                navigate to to directory and initialize it with the git init command. This will create a .git file that contains all the repository files. At this point your repository is still empty. You can add the files you want to track to the repository
                with the git add command. To clone an existing git repository you use the command git clone. Note that the command is clone and not check out as you might see with another VCS. Instead of just getting limited working copy, git gets you
                every version of almost every file in the repository that is stored on the server it is hosted on. If the repository on the server gets corrupted you can restore the repository from one of the clones. You can designate where you want the
                repository cloned to in the git cloned command. Git has several different transfer protocols to choose from. This includes https:// and git://.</p>

            <p class="lead">
Files that you are currently working on should be separate copy called a working tree. When you are finished editing a file and are ready to commit it the file should be moved over to the index or staging area. There are two types of files in a git working tree tracked and untracked. Tracked files are files that were included in the last snapshot. Tracked files can have a status of unmodified, modified or staged.  Use the git status command to find out if any files need to be committed or are untracked and need t o be added. Untracked files are files that were not in your last snapshot. Untracked files need to be added using the git add command.  In order to stage a file that has been modified use the git add command. Otherwise git will recognize the file as modified but not staged to commit the file and the file will not be committed. If you modify a file after it has been staged it has to be staged again using the git add command. Otherwise git will commit the previous version of the file that was staged. If you use the git status command after editing staged file it will display as both staged and unstaged.</p>
